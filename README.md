# RV32-Digital-Circuit-

Implementing part of processor to execute a subset of the RISC-V RV32I arithmetic-logical instructions.
The instructions implemented are shown below. 
In order to build the 32bit ALU I started with 1Bit Full Adder, 1Bit then 4Bit, 16Bit and finally 32Bit
32 Bit ALU can perform and, or, xor, add, and sub. 
I then built a register file with 32 32-bit registers.
